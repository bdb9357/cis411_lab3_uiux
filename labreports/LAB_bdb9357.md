List of Competitors
1. Competitor 1 [The View](https://ssb8c.messiah.edu/ssb8/mc_schdlist.P_Schedule_List_Init?TERM_IN=200810)
2. Competitor 2 [Degreeworks](https://degreeworks-c.messiah.edu:8441/worksheets/WEB31)

## Step 3.3 Write a Useability Test

| Step | Tasks | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 1 |  Find what semester CIS384 is offered | This is to see how easily it is to find a course and its info |
| 2 |  Find requirements for a BIS concentration | This is to see how quickly a user can find concentration requirements |
| 3 |  Print information from both previous steps | This is to see if the user is able to print both steps on one page or if the information is more spread out |

## Step 3.4 Observe User Interactions

| Step | Tasks | Observations |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Find what semester CIS384 is offered  | Found it with minimal issue |
| 2 | Find requirements for a BIS concentration  | Took a while to find the what if function in degreeworks, but completed it |
| 3 | Print information from both previous steps  |  Was only able to print one page at a time, with a minute of navigation inbetween |


## Step 3.5 Findings
Successful test. Was able to see how easy it was to navigate current pages used for course information. The test highlights the importance of centralizing the information for our project. Next test it would be helpful to ask the user to navigate to more places to find information such as major info or finding what professors teach a specific course.
